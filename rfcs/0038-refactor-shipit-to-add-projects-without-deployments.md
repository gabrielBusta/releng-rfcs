# RFC 38 - Refactor shipit to allow new projects to be added without custom code or deployments

## Summary

Onboarding new products onto shipit releases requires making changes to the [shipit source code][0].

## Motivation

Refactoring shipit to allow new projects without changes to the shipit source code would reduce the time and effort necessary to get new shipping on with shipit. Currently, adding custom code for each new project could take 2-3 months, quickly adding up to one year of people weeks to add 4-6 projects.
